Description
-----------

It turns out that this combinator

````Haskell
f ~@~ g = (f .) . (. g)
````

is a powerful thing. It was abstracted from following (commonly used)
pattern `f . h . g` where `f` and `g` are fixed.

This library not only defines `~@~` combinator, but also some derived
combinators that can help us to easily define a lot of things including
lenses. See [lens package][Hackage: lens] for details on what lenses are.

Function `Data.Function.on` can be implemented using `~@~` as:

````Haskell
on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
on f g = (id ~@~ g ~@~ g) f
````

If function @on3@ existed in /base/ then it could be defined as:

````Haskell
on3 :: (b -> b -> b -> d) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> a -> d
on3 f g = (id ~@~ g ~@~ g ~@~ g) f
````

For more examples see documentation.

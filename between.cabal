synopsis:               Function combinator "between" and derived combinators
description:
  It turns out that this combinator
  .
  > f ~@~ g = (f .) . (. g)
  .
  is a powerful thing. It was abstracted from following (commonly used)
  pattern @f . h . g@ where @f@ and @g@ are fixed.
  .
  This library not only defines @~\@~@ combinator, but also some derived
  combinators that can help us easily define a lot of things including
  lenses. See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens package> for
  details on what lenses are.
  .
  Function @Data.Function.on@ can be implemented using @~\@~@ as:
  .
  > on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
  > on f g = (id ~@~ g ~@~ g) f
  .
  If function @on3@ existed in /base/ then it could be defined as:
  .
  > on3 :: (b -> b -> b -> d) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> a -> d
  > on3 f g = (id ~@~ g ~@~ g ~@~ g) f
  .
  Other usage examples and documentation can be found in
  "Data.Function.Between" module.
